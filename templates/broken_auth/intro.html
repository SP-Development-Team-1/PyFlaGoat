		<h4><b>What is Broken Authentication</b></h4>
		<p class="bp">Broken authentication is an umbrella term for several vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to
			impersonate legitimate users online. Broadly, broken authentication refers to weaknesses in two areas:
			session management and credential management. Both are classified as broken authentication because attackers
			can use either avenue to masquerade as a user: hijacked session IDs or stolen login credentials.

			Attackers employ a wide variety of strategies to take advantage of these weaknesses, ranging from huge
			credential stuffing attacks to highly targeted schemes aimed at gaining access to a specific personâ€™s
			credentials.

		<h4><b>Mitigation</b></h4>
		<p class="bp">
			This type of authentication flaw can be mitigated by:
			<ul>
				<li>Using captcha</li>
				<li>Rate Limiting by reducing the number of tries for a particular user, based on session or ip</li>
				<li>Blocking multiple request form the same IP</li>
			</ul>
